neural style transfer
=========================================

I wrote a simple python script to peform neural style transfer using a pretrained tensorflow [model](https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/a%20rbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2). I still need to figure out how I want to implement a lightbox or gallery into this website. I'd like to keep things simple and use mostly static html. The source code is available on [github](https://github.com/duncanldaho/unstop) for now.
