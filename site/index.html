<p>Hello, my name is Duncan.</p>
<p>I want to learn more about web hosting so I use this domain to workshop stuff. It only costs about five dollars per month and I get that value out of the domain name alone. The first thing I did was start writing static HTML by hand, but that is a slow way to learn. I tried out a few content management systems like Hugo and Pico, but they were too complex and lacked detailed documentation. This site is built with <strong>untitled</strong>, which uses a small bash script to convert markdown into HTML. This website is vary basic, I think it looks great.</p>
<p>One of the first projects I worked on is <strong>unstop</strong>. Written in python, it performs neural style transfer utilizing a pre-trained model. It was a good project to learn some python basics, but I donâ€™t like how little control I have over the model. I would like to write a new version from scratch that is easier to configure. Audio style transfer also sounds incredibly fascinating.</p>
<p>This site is just a place for me to workshop ideas and store resources for later, but feel free to look around.</p>
