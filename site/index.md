Hello, my name is Duncan.

I want to learn more about web hosting so I use this domain to workshop stuff.
It only costs about five dollars per month and I get that value out of
the domain name alone. The first thing I did was start writing static HTML by
hand, but that is a slow way to learn. I tried out a few content management
systems like Hugo and Pico, but they were too complex and lacked detailed
documentation. This site is built with **untitled**, which uses a small bash
script to convert markdown into HTML. This website is vary basic, I think it
looks great.

One of the first projects I worked on is **unstop**. Written in
python, it performs neural style transfer utilizing a pre-trained model. It was
a good project to learn some python basics, but I don't like how little control
I have over the model. I would like to write a new version from scratch that is
easier to configure. Audio style transfer also sounds incredibly fascinating.

This site is just a place for me to workshop ideas and store resources for
later, but feel free to look around.
