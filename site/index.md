I wanted to learn more about web hosting so I use this domain to workshop stuff. It only costs about five dollars per month to host and the domain name was too good to pass up. Originally I threw together a poorly designed site built with Pico CMS, but it was too flashy and the javascript was a mess. This site is static html built with [untitled](https://untitled.vimuser.org/).

I'd like to get a place to show style transfers, but I still working out the best way to implement it.

This site is just a place for me to workshop ideas and store resources for later, but feel free to look around.
