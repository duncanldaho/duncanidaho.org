Hello, my name is Duncan.

I want to learn more about web design and hosting so I use this domain to
workshop ideas.  It only costs about five dollars per month and I think I get
that value out of the domain name alone. The first thing I did was start writing
static HTML by hand, but that is a slow way to learn. I tried out a few content
management systems like Hugo and Pico, but they were too complex and lacked
detailed documentation. This site is built with untitled, which uses a small
bash script to convert markdown into HTML. This website is very basic, I think
it looks great.

One of the first projects I worked on is **unstop**. Written in python, it
performs neural style transfer utilizing a pre-trained model. It was a good
project to learn some python basics, but I don't like how little control I have
over the model. Eventually I would like to train models, but I'm not quite there
yet. Audio style transfer also sounds incredibly fascinating.

This site is just a place for me to workshop ideas and store resources for
later, but feel free to look around.
